In this scenario you learned how to create a new Citrus project using one of the predefined Maven project archetypes.
 
Also you created a new Citrus endpoint component that is able to send/receive message on an in memory message channel. The integration test
that we have created sends some message to that channel and receives that very same message in the next step.

This approach is the very basic scheme that Citrus tests follow. We configure endpoint components for different messaging transports
and use send end receive operations for exchanging messages in an integration test scenario.

## Congratulations!

**You've completed the scenario!**
